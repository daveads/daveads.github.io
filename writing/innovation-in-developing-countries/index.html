		<p><b>Note:</b> These are based on my views on factors affecting the rate of innovation in developing countries. I might be wrong, but at the same time, I might be right.</p>
<p>Writing this article feels a little weird for me; it seems like something I should not write about, but I also have the feeling that I should do it anyway. <strong>Keeping this as short as possible, I won't be able to cover all areas.</strong></p>
<p>People in developing countries seem to believe that the governing entities are solely responsible for bringing about technological innovation <strong>(this is done indirectly)</strong>, which is something I <strong>strongly disagree with</strong>. I guess I am not expressing this in the right way; coming from a tech background, there is a lot I don't fully understand about politics. It's not an excuse, but rather than complaining, that energy should be directed towards something else.</p>
<p>Secondly, the mindset (culture) and beliefs of the people are really mind-blowing. I love this quote: <cite>"You are what you believe in."</cite> It's really funny how, at the age of 20-25 in most cases, you are still considered incapable of making decisions that could cause a serious change in society, down to individual families, and this becomes a loop.</p>
<p><strong>It makes me wonder what the adults spend their youthful age doing in their 20's....???</strong> This makes me want to give examples of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg...</p>
<p>To a point, you can't entirely blame society for this; many youths spend their time in the most unproductive ways you could ever think of, involving themselves in internet fraud and other criminal activities, etc.</p>
<p><strong>There is a lot at play here:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Lack of knowledge, even in a major field (poor education background, mostly outdated curriculum).</li>
<li>Lack of infrastructure, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Technological innovation can be brought about by innovative individuals (Tech Visionaries) who:</p>
<p>x. See things differently.<br>
x. Have a serious, intense passion for what they do.<br>
x. Are ready to take action no matter the odds.<br>
x. Are tired of doing things the old way (with low outcomes).<br>
x. Are highly curious (question everything) and have the ability to connect the dots.<br></p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, one person can't actually change the world; you are going to work together with intelligent humans and people who think alike to actually make a mark.</p>
