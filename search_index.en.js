Concurrency is executing tasks at the same time but not necessarily simultaneously.\nConcurrency is handled differently in various processors. In a single core, concurrency is handled via a process called context-switching.\nParallelism:\nGiven a task of cooking and speaking to a friend over the phone, these two tasks can be done simultaneously.\n\n\"Parallelism means performing two or more tasks simultaneously. Parallel computing in computer science refers to the process of performing multiple calculations simultaneously.\"\n\nConcurrency and parallelism refer to computer architectures focused on how tasks or computations are performed:\n\nIn a single core, concurrency happens with tasks executing over the same time period via context switching, i.e. only one task gets executed.\nIn a multi-core environment, concurrency can be achieved via parallelism, in which multiple tasks are executed simultaneously.\n\nThreads &amp; Processes\nThreads: These are sequences of executing code that can be executed independently of one another. A program can be single-threaded or multi-threaded. It's the smallest unit of a task that can be executed by an OS.\nProcesses: A program is an instance of a running program. A program can have multiple processes. A process usually starts with a single thread but down the line of execution, it can create multiple threads.\nSync and Async\nTasks are executed one after the other, e.g. giving a task to write a letter to your mom and a letter to your friend.\nAsync: When one task gets executed, you could switch to a different task without waiting for the previous one to get completed.\n\nSync and Async are programming models.\n\nSynchronous and Asynchronous in a Single and Multi-threaded Environment\nSynchronous:\n\nSingle-threaded: Each task gets executed one after another. Each task waits for its previous task to get executed.\nMulti-threaded: Tasks get executed in different threads but wait for any other executing tasks on any other thread.\n\nAsynchronous:\n\nSingle-threaded: Tasks start executing without waiting for a different task to finish. At a given time, a single task gets executed.\nMulti-threaded: Tasks get executed in different threads without waiting for any tasks and independently finish off their executions.\n\nConcurrency and Parallelism:\n\nThe way tasks are executed.\n\nSynchronous and Asynchronous -&gt;\n\nProgramming models.\n\nSingle-threaded and Multi-threaded -&gt;\n\nThe environment of task execution.\n\nAsync helps to achieve concurrency. Async in a multithread environment is a way to achieve parallelism.\nSynchronously: This is how we code normally:\n\n\"You wait for an operation to finish before going to the next or moving over to the other one.\"\n\n\n\nConcurrency: Threading, async I/O\nParallelism: Multiprocessing\n\n\nLinks:\nMedium Article\n","id":"https://daveads.github.io/note/concurrency-vs-multi-threading-vs-asynchronous-programming/","title":"Concurrency vs Multi-threading vs Asynchronous Programming"},"https://daveads.github.io/note/do-the-work/":{"body":"ORIENTATION ENEMIES AND ALLIES\nEnemies:{\n\n}\nwar of art // am not reading that\nRESISTANCE\n\nresistance is a force of nature\nresistance never sleep and fear doesn't go away\n\nCODE:: THE BATTLE MUST BE FOUGHT ANEW EVERYDAY\nRational thought\n\nthe deeper the source we work from, the better our stuff will be and the more tranformative it will be for us and for those we share it with.\nFriends and Family\nTHOUGHTS**\nso true, the last thing anyone would want is to remain as they are\nOUR ALLIES\n\nStupidity\nStubbornness\nBlind faith\nPassion\nAssistance (the opposite of Resistance)\nFriends and family\n\nSTAY STUPID\n\n\nDon't think act We can always revise and revisit once we’ve acted.

Common methods of voicing chords:\nRoot Position and Inversions\n\nRoot Position: The root of the chord is the lowest note.  1 - 3 - 5 - 7\n1st Inversion: The third of the chord is the lowest note. 3 - 5 - 7 - 1\n2nd Inversion: The fifth of the chord is the lowest note. 5 - 7 - 1 - 3\n3rd Inversion (for 7th chords): The seventh of the chord is the lowest note. 7 - 1 - 3 - 5\n\nClosed and Open Voicings\n\nClosed Voicing: All chord tones are within an octave. 1 - 3 - 5 - 7\nOpen Voicing: Chord tones are spread out, often spanning more than an octave. 1 - 5 - 7 - 3\n\nDrop Voicings\n\nDrop 2 Voicing: The second highest note of a closed voicing is dropped an octave.     5 - 1 - 3 - 7\nDrop 3 Voicing: The third highest note of a closed voicing is dropped an octave.      3 - 7 - 1 - 5\nDrop 2 and 4 Voicing: Both the second and fourth highest notes are dropped an octave. 3 - 5 - 7 - 1\n\nQuartal and Quintal Voicings\n\nQuartal Voicing: Chords built in fourths (e.g., C-F-Bb).  1 - 4 - b7 (or 1 - 4 - 7)\nQuintal Voicing: Chords built in fifths (e.g., C-G-D).    1 - 5 - 9\n\nCluster Voicings\n\nTone Clusters: Chords with notes that are close together, often including seconds and minor seconds.\n\nShell Voicings\n\nLeft Hand Shells: Often used in jazz, consisting of the root, third, and seventh (or sometimes the root and seventh, or root and third).\n\nUpper Structure Triads\nCombining a triad (often major or minor) over a different bass note to create complex chords (e.g., an E major triad over a C bass note for a Cmaj#11 sound).  1 - 3 - #11 - 7\nSo What Voicing\nBased on the voicing used in the Miles Davis tune \"So What,\" consisting of a stack of fourths with a major third on top (e.g., D-G-C-F-A).  1 - 4 - 7 - 3 - 6\nRootless Voicings\n\nRootless Left Hand Voicings: Often used in jazz, where the left hand plays the third and seventh (and possibly other tensions) while the root is implied or played by a bass player.\n\nGuide Tone Voicings\nChords reduced to their essential tones, often the third and seventh, which guide the harmony.\nPractical Examples\n\nCmaj7 (root position): C-E-G-B    1 - 3 - 5 - 7\nCmaj7 (1st inversion): E-G-B-C    3 - 5 - 7 - 1\nCmaj7 (2nd inversion): G-B-C-E    5 - 7 - 1 - 3\nCmaj7 (3rd inversion): B-C-E-G    7 - 1 - 3 - 5\nCmaj7 (closed voicing): C-E-G-B   1 - 3 - 5 - 7\nCmaj7 (open voicing): C-G-B-E     1 - 5 - 7 - 3\nCmaj7 (drop 2 voicing): G-C-E-B   5 - 1 - 3 - 7\nCmaj7 (shell voicing): C-E-B      1 - 3 - 7\n\nJazz-Specific Voicings\n\nC7 (rootless left hand voicing): E-Bb (3rd and 7th)   3 - b7\nC7 (upper structure triad): E-G#-C# (augmented triad over C)  3 - #5 - #1\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        Tips for Jazz Voicings\n        \n        \nUse Tensions: Add 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths to enrich the harmony.\nVoice Leading: Smooth transitions between chords by moving the smallest distance possible.\nAvoid Doubling: Especially the root and fifth, unless stylistically appropriate.\n\n\n    \n\n","id":"https://daveads.github.io/note/piano-chord-voicing-techniques-in-jazz/","title":"Piano Chord Voicing Techniques in Jazz"},"https://daveads.github.io/note/postgresql/":{"body":"Postgresql Local development setup\nThere are no users in PostgreSQL, only roles.\npostgres account is created by default\nsudo -i -u postgres : To switch in the postgress account then psql to start postgresql interactive terminal\nOR\nsudo -u postgres psql : This log you directly into postgres\nTHIS COMMANDS CAN BE RUN WITH THE POSTGRESS ACCOUNT\n\\du : List all user accounts or roles\nCreating a new role\ncreateuser --interactive: Within the postgres account\nOr\nsudo -u postgres createuser --interactive without switching in the postgres account first\nWithin the postgresql interactive terminal\nSELECT datname FROM pg_database;

The problem with the coherence theory is that a belief could be consistent with my other beliefs and yet the whole lot could be false. —Colin McGinn (2015a, p. 148) According to the coherence theory of truth (see Young 2018), a set of propositions (or beliefs, or sentences) is true iff:they are mutually consistent, and 2.they are supported by, or consistent with, all available evidence; that is, they “cohere” with each other and with all evidence. Note that observation statements (that is, descriptions of what we observe in the world around us) are among the claims that must be mutually consistent, so this is\nnot (necessarily) a “pie-in-the-sky” theory that doesn’t have to relate to the way things\nreally are. It just says that we don’t have to have independent access to “reality” in\norder to determine truth.\n2.4.3Correspondence vs. Coherence Which theory is correct? Well, for one thing, there are more than two theories: There\nare several versions of each kind of theory, and there are other theories of truth that\ndon’t fall under either category. The most important of the other theories is the “prag-\nmatic” theory of truth (see Glanzberg 2016, §3; Misak and Talisse 2019). Here is one\nversion: [T]he pragmatic theory of truth . . . is that a proposition is true if and only\n[if] it is useful [that is, “pragmatic”, or practical] to believe that proposi-\ntion. (McGinn, 2015a, p. 148, my interpolated brackets)\nAnother version states that a belief, proposition, or sentence is true iff it continues to\nbe accepted at the limit of inquiry:\nTruth is that to which a belief would tend were it to tend indefinitely to a fixed\nbelief. (Edwin Martin, Jr., paraphrasing C.S. Peirce; lectures on the theory of\nknowledge,Spring 1973; for more on Peirce, see §2.6.1.3,below.)46\n\nIndentation in python is very important because with out proper indenting you will end up seeing IndentationError: examples as seen below\n\nIn python when defining statement for functions and loops you do this using four white spaces or a single tab according to python indentation rules\n\nImportants of indentation:\n\n\thelps to properly structure the code\n\tmakes the code beautiful (human readable)\n\nPython's Style guide pep8\nsource code\n","id":"https://daveads.github.io/writing/indentation-in-python/","title":"Indentation in Python"},"https://daveads.github.io/writing/innovation-in-developing-countries/":{"body":"Note: These are based on my views on factors affecting the rate of innovation in developing countries. I might be wrong, but at the same time, I might be right.\nWriting this article feels a little weird for me; it seems like something I should not write about, but I also have the feeling that I should do it anyway. Keeping this as short as possible, I won't be able to cover all areas.\nPeople in developing countries seem to believe that the governing entities are solely responsible for bringing about technological innovation (this is done indirectly), which is something I strongly disagree with. I guess I am not expressing this in the right way; coming from a tech background, there is a lot I don't fully understand about politics. It's not an excuse, but rather than complaining, that energy should be directed towards something else.\nSecondly, the mindset (culture) and beliefs of the people are really mind-blowing. I love this quote: \"You are what you believe in.\" It's really funny how, at the age of 20-25 in most cases, you are still considered incapable of making decisions that could cause a serious change in society, down to individual families, and this becomes a loop.\nIt makes me wonder what the adults spend their youthful age doing in their 20's....??? This makes me want to give examples of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg...\nTo a point, you can't entirely blame society for this; many youths spend their time in the most unproductive ways you could ever think of, involving themselves in internet fraud and other criminal activities, etc.\nThere is a lot at play here:\n\nLack of knowledge, even in a major field (poor education background, mostly outdated curriculum).\nLack of infrastructure, etc.\n\nTechnological innovation can be brought about by innovative individuals (Tech Visionaries) who:\nx. See things differently.\nx. Have a serious, intense passion for what they do.\nx. Are ready to take action no matter the odds.\nx. Are tired of doing things the old way (with low outcomes).\nx. Are highly curious (question everything) and have the ability to connect the dots.\nDon't get me wrong, one person can't actually change the world; you are going to work together with intelligent humans and people who think alike to actually make a mark.\n","id":"https://daveads.github.io/writing/innovation-in-developing-countries/","title":"Technological Innovation in developing countries"},"https://daveads.github.io/writing/interesting-programming-and-cs-books/":{"body":"// Books i find interesting....

The shell is a program that takes in Commands or #keywords and passes them to the operating system to carry out. it's a way of interacting with the computer os, similiar to the GUI but faster and more powerful. The program which handles this commands in the terminal emulator is the Command-line interpreter (shell).\nShell Scripting:\nAs earlier said a Unix shell or shell is a command-line interpreter but also a programming language, the programming language features allows us to combine commands or (utilities) together in a file and run them as a scripts, and yea you can also call it a Script language for now the major focus is getting you to understand the command line and having the feels of it without getting intimidated.. will write more on Shell script on Using The Linux Command Line(1) or probably the next.\nRunning the Termainal emulator:\nComputer terminal:\n\nBefore delving into what the Terminal emulator actually is, it's important to know where it all started decades ago. Computers had no GUI for accessing or modifying data; the computer terminal was the only means of entering, displaying, and printing data. These terminals were physical computing devices like IBM 3270, VT100, and many others. For more details, check out computer terminal &gt;&gt; wiki.\nWhat's a Terminal emulator:\nThe Terminal emulator is a software designed to replicate the functions of a computer terminal. It is a GUI application needed to access the Unix shell environment, providing an interface to invoke commands, scripts, and programs available on your system. It also allows you to view and browse through the contents of directories, just like you would with a FILE MANAGER APPLICATION.\nEvery Linux distro comes with a default terminal emulator. For instance, Ubuntu and Fedora come with Gnome terminal emulator, and other Linux distros have their own defaults. The first thing you see in the terminal emulator is the \"command prompt,\" which shows $, %, #, or &gt;, indicating the current working directory, the current user, and the readiness of the shell to accept commands from you.\nThe default shell for most Unix or Unix-like systems is the bash shell. Other shells include sh, zsh, csh, and more. To find out the available shells on your system, use the command:\n\nDisplay content in your file directory\nThe ls command is used to print out the current directory on the terminal emulator screen, giving the same result as the File Manager.\n\n\nTo find out what a command means through the command line, type:\n\nYou can also make use of the system's manual pager for the full documentation:\n\nTo print your current working directory, use the command pwd.\n\nThe pwd is a built-in command within the bash shell itself. Type help to find out more about built-in commands.\nTime for Experiments\nHere are some common commands:\nCommandMeaning\nlsList files and directories in the current directory.\ncdChange the current working directory.\npwdPrint the current working directory.\nmkdirCreate a new directory (folder).\nrmdirRemove a directory (folder).\ncpCopy files or directories.\nmvMove or rename files or directories.\nrmRemove (delete) files or directories.\ncatConcatenate and display file content.\nmoreDisplay file content one screen at a time.\nlessDisplay file content with backward navigation.\nheadDisplay the beginning lines of a file.\ntailDisplay the ending lines of a file.\ngrepSearch for a pattern in files.\nfindSearch for files and directories.\nchmodChange file permissions.\nchownChange file ownership.\npsDisplay information about running processes.\nkillTerminate processes.\nsshSecure Shell - remote login to a server.\nwgetDownload files from the web.\ntarArchive files using tar.\nzipPackage and compress files.\n\nPlease note that this is not an exhaustive list, but it includes some commonly used commands and their primary meanings. Additionally, the meaning of some commands may vary based on their options and arguments. Always refer to the manual (man command) for a comprehensive understanding of each command.\nResources\nThe Missing Semester of Your CS Education By Mit\n","id":"https://daveads.github.io/writing/the-linux-command-line/","title":"The Linux Command line interface(0)"},"https://daveads.github.io/writing/thinking-while-walking/":{"body":"Having been experiencing writer’s block since the last time i wrote new resolution, Recently i was asked why i preferred walking to driving or using the public transport, i was unable to give a straight answer to that, Though i had reasons i just don't know why it happens.\nE.g:\n\n\nWalking helped me fix more bugs than i could imagine..\n\n\nI do most of my best thinking while walking alone*.\n\n\nIt helps me calm my nerves…\n\n\nYet i was unable to put the whole piece together,the question fired up more unanswered questions, so i did some googling.\nThe Science behind it:\n\nWhen we go for a walk, the heart pumps faster, circulating more blood and oxygen not just to the muscles but to all the organs—including the brain,  Walking on a regular basis also promotes new connections between brain cells, staves off the usual withering of brain tissue that comes with age, increases the volume of the hippocampus (a brain region crucial for memory), and elevates levels of molecules that both stimulate the growth of new neurons and transmit messages between them.\n\n\nBenefit of walking :\n\n\nWalking boost creativity.\n\n\nWalking sparks connections between brain cells.\n\n\nIt strengthens your hippocampus.\n\n\nWalking increases blood flow in your brain\n\n\n\nArticles\n\n\nwalking Vs sitting\n\n\nwalking helps us think\n\n\nbenfits of walking\n\n\nways walking changes your brain\n\n\n","id":"https://daveads.github.io/writing/thinking-while-walking/","title":"How thinking while walking helps in fixing bugs"},"https://daveads.github.io/writing/two-mind-blowing-articles/":{"body":"Articles on Startups and Success\n\n\nHow To Be Successful \n\n\nHard Startups\n\n\n\nHow to be successful :\nEveryone has a different definition of success, irrespective of those beliefs we all do have a specific goal in mind that is to be successful.\nMeaning we do all have to put in the hard work, sleepless night and also working smart.\nSam altman actually explained, so I won't go into full details you can always read the articles.\nSelf belief:\nNot believing in yourself makes the whole process even harder, this made me remember one of steve job's quote..\n\n\"The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the one who do.\"\n\n\nLearning to think independently:\nThere is always a solution to every problem, success is actually 99% failure and 1% success, one thing i learn to do is treat every failed attempt as an experiment or a learning process...\n\nFocus:\nThis is one of the quality i currently lack, According to Steve Jobs,\n\n“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on.
