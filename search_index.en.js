Like, when you hit Ctrl+C, that sends a SIGINT signal to your script. Normally, that would just kill it, but trap lets you catch it and do some cleanup before you exit.\nE.g.\nThis is commonly used in installers, backup scripts, and other tools where interruption could leave the system in a bad state.\nThe Problem: trap '' is Special\nHere's the thing about trap '' - it's not intuitive at first glance. You might think an empty string means \"do nothing,\" which sounds like it should behave the same as trap ' ' (a space) or trap '# comment'. But it doesn't!\nIn POSIX shells, trap '' has a very specific meaning: it tells the OS to ignore the signal entirely by setting it to SIG_IGN. This is fundamentally different from running an empty command:\ntrap '' SIGINT → Sets signal to SIG_IGN (kernel ignores it)\ntrap ' ' SIGINT → Wakes up the shell to execute a space (does nothing, but still wakes up!)\ntrap '# comment' SIGINT → Wakes up the shell to execute a comment\nThe difference matters for performance and correctness. When a signal is set to SIG_IGN, the kernel drops it immediately. When you have a trap handler (even an empty one), the shell has to wake up, check what to do, execute the handler, and resume.\nYou can verify this by checking /proc/self/status. Here's a demo from the Oils test suite:\nWithout trap:\nWith trap '' SIGUSR2:\nSee how USR2(12) appears under SigIgn (ignored), not under SigCgt (caught)? That's because trap '' sets the signal to SIG_IGN at the kernel level. This is fundamentally different from catching the signal and executing an empty handler.\nWhy Add trap --ignore?\nWhile trap '' is POSIX-compliant, it's not very clear what it means just by reading the code. Is it ignoring the signal? Resetting it? Setting a default handler?\nYSH's trap --ignore makes the intent explicit:\nThis explicitness helps future readers understand that we're setting SIG_IGN, which is different from SIG_DFL (the default handler you get with trap - INT).\nThe Design Choice: Why command.NoOp?\nOnce we understand that trap '' should set SIG_IGN, the question becomes: how do we represent this in the codebase?\nThe Evolution\nThe implementation went through several iterations:\n1. Initial approach: Special handling everywhere\nMy first attempt added separate branches for ignored signals throughout the codebase:\nSpecial branches in _AddTheRest() for the ignore case\nDuplicated logic in AddItem() to track ignored signals differently\nCustom printing code in _PrintTrapEntry()\nThis worked, but created a lot of duplication. The code got longer and harder to follow.\n2. Using command.NoOp\nAndy suggested representing ignored signals as command.NoOp from the AST. This made the code much shorter! Instead of special handling everywhere, we just check if handler.tag() == command_e.NoOp at the critical points. The existing code paths mostly just worked.\nWhy does this work? The shell already has command.NoOp for representing \"do nothing\" commands like sh -c '' (an empty command). Reusing it for ignored traps seemed natural.\n3. The bug with command.IgnoredTrap\nAt one point, we tried command.IgnoredTrap instead - the reasoning being that we shouldn't use the same enum for two different things (command.NoOp for both empty commands and ignored traps).\nBut this introduced a bug! In some code paths, we would try to execute command.IgnoredTrap as if it were a normal command. Using the same type for two semantically different things caused confusion.\n4. Final solution: trap_action.Ignored\nThe final refactoring introduced a new algebraic data type trap_action:\nThis makes it explicit in the type system: a trap action is either \"ignored\" or \"runs a command.\" No confusion possible! The type system enforces that we handle both cases correctly.\nNote\nThis post describes the implementation using command.NoOp (PR #2586), but the code has since been refactored to use trap_action.Ignored - see commit 6f1c64891. The refactoring makes the intent even clearer in the type system.\nWhy Algebraic Data Types?\nThis evolution shows why Oils uses algebraic data types (ADTs) extensively. Instead of having if statements scattered throughout the code checking \"is this an ignored trap?\", we put that distinction into the data representation itself.\nAs Andy puts it: \"the if statements are in data, rather than code\" - which makes the code shorter and harder to misuse. The type checker enforces that you handle both Ignored and Command(c) cases, preventing bugs like the command.IgnoredTrap issue above.\nHow It Works Under the Hood\nThe Core Logic\nHere's what happens in TrapState.AddUserTrap() when you set a trap:\nThe key insight: I check if the handler is a NoOp, and if so, call iolib.sigaction(sig_num, SIG_IGN) to actually ignore the signal at the OS level.\nWhy SIGINT and SIGWINCH Are Special\nSIGINT and SIGWINCH need special handling because the shell interpreter itself cares about them:\nSIGINT - For handling Ctrl-C / KeyboardInterrupt\nCPython has built-in handling for this\nmycpp runtime calls RegisterSignalInterest(SIGINT) and polls with PollSigInt() in the main loop\nSIGWINCH - For terminal resize events that affect line editing\nHere's something interesting: when you do trap '' SIGINT, the signal_safe calls look the same as trap - SIGINT (both call SetSigIntTrapped(False)).

Concurrency is executing tasks at the same time but not necessarily simultaneously.\nConcurrency is handled differently in various processors. In a single core, concurrency is handled via a process called context-switching.\nParallelism:\nGiven a task of cooking and speaking to a friend over the phone, these two tasks can be done simultaneously.\n\"Parallelism means performing two or more tasks simultaneously. Parallel computing in computer science refers to the process of performing multiple calculations simultaneously.\"\nConcurrency and parallelism refer to computer architectures focused on how tasks or computations are performed:\nIn a single core, concurrency happens with tasks executing over the same time period via context switching, i.e. only one task gets executed.\nIn a multi-core environment, concurrency can be achieved via parallelism, in which multiple tasks are executed simultaneously.\nThreads &amp; Processes\nThreads: These are sequences of executing code that can be executed independently of one another. A program can be single-threaded or multi-threaded. It's the smallest unit of a task that can be executed by an OS.\nProcesses: A program is an instance of a running program. A program can have multiple processes.

Each task waits for its previous task to get executed.\nMulti-threaded: Tasks get executed in different threads but wait for any other executing tasks on any other thread.\nAsynchronous:\nSingle-threaded: Tasks start executing without waiting for a different task to finish.

It contains a colon-separated list of patterns - any file matching these patterns gets filtered out of glob results.\nE.g.\nThis is useful for build directories, ignoring compiled files, or filtering out backup files from shell expansions.\nThe Problem: Glob Results Need Filtering\nWhen you write echo * in a shell, it expands to all files in the current directory. But sometimes you want to exclude certain patterns - like object files in a build directory, or backup files ending in ~.\nBash solves this with GLOBIGNORE. When set:\nGlob patterns automatically include dotfiles (like dotglob option)\nFiles matching any GLOBIGNORE pattern are filtered out\n. and .. are always filtered (even if they don't match a pattern)\nThe Implementation\nWhere the Code Lives\nThe implementation is in osh/glob_.py in the Globber class. The key changes:\nParse GLOBIGNORE patterns - Split the colon-separated string into individual patterns\nFilter glob results - After libc's glob() returns matches, filter out anything matching GLOBIGNORE\nEnable dotglob implicitly - When GLOBIGNORE is set, dotfiles are included in glob expansion\nParsing GLOBIGNORE\nThe tricky part: colons inside bracket expressions like [[:alnum:]] shouldn't be treated as separators. I handle this by tracking bracket depth:\nCaching for Performance\nAndy suggested caching the parsed patterns. Since GLOBIGNORE doesn't change often during script execution, we avoid re-parsing the same string:\nThe cache maps the raw GLOBIGNORE string to its parsed pattern list.\nFiltering Results\nAfter glob() returns matches, I filter them. This is a module-level helper function:\nIn _Glob(), the filtering has two branches - one for when GLOBIGNORE is set, and one for the default behavior:\nImplicit dotglob\nWhen GLOBIGNORE is set, bash enables dotglob automatically. I replicate this:\nTest Coverage\nThe spec test file spec/globignore.test.sh went from oils_failures_allowed: 14 to oils_failures_allowed: 1 - meaning 13 previously-failing test cases now pass.\nI also added a new test case to verify that . and .. are always filtered when GLOBIGNORE is set:\nRunning the Tests\nTo verify the implementation:\nDemo\nPull request :: #2505","id":"https://daveads.github.io/note/implementing-globignore/","title":"Implementing GLOBIGNORE"},"https://daveads.github.io/note/increase-weight/":{"body":"// More Food\nCalorie-Dense Food List\nHigh in fat and protein:\nFat\nNuts\nSeeds\nAvocados\nOlive Oil\nProtein\nMeat\nFish\nEggs\nDairy\nCarbohydrate-Rich Foods\nGrains\nRice\nStarchy Vegetables\nPotatoes\nCorn\nPeas\nFruits\nBananas\nMangoes\nDried Fruit","id":"https://daveads.github.io/note/increase-weight/","title":"Calorie-Dense Food List"},"https://daveads.github.io/note/increasing-bench-press-max/":{"body":"Pull-ups : for back muscles to help control the weight on the way down\nPush-ups\nDumbbell shoulder\nDips : for triceps\nSquatting","id":"https://daveads.github.io/note/increasing-bench-press-max/","title":"schedule to improve bench press"},"https://daveads.github.io/note/jan-reads/":{"body":"My January Reads\nAddicted to being useful\n//Thoughts\nI feel there is always going to be something to do, working on something entirely new, something that never existed, something that requires a new kind of architecture.\nSomething the world needs.

Common methods of voicing chords:\nRoot Position and Inversions\nRoot Position: The root of the chord is the lowest note. 1 - 3 - 5 - 7\n1st Inversion: The third of the chord is the lowest note. 3 - 5 - 7 - 1\n2nd Inversion: The fifth of the chord is the lowest note. 5 - 7 - 1 - 3\n3rd Inversion (for 7th chords): The seventh of the chord is the lowest note. 7 - 1 - 3 - 5\nClosed and Open Voicings\nClosed Voicing: All chord tones are within an octave. 1 - 3 - 5 - 7\nOpen Voicing: Chord tones are spread out, often spanning more than an octave. 1 - 5 - 7 - 3\nDrop Voicings\nDrop 2 Voicing: The second highest note of a closed voicing is dropped an octave. 5 - 1 - 3 - 7\nDrop 3 Voicing: The third highest note of a closed voicing is dropped an octave. 3 - 7 - 1 - 5\nDrop 2 and 4 Voicing: Both the second and fourth highest notes are dropped an octave. 3 - 5 - 7 - 1\nQuartal and Quintal Voicings\nQuartal Voicing: Chords built in fourths (e.g., C-F-Bb). 1 - 4 - b7 (or 1 - 4 - 7)\nQuintal Voicing: Chords built in fifths (e.g., C-G-D). 1 - 5 - 9\nCluster Voicings\nTone Clusters: Chords with notes that are close together, often including seconds and minor seconds.\nShell Voicings\nLeft Hand Shells: Often used in jazz, consisting of the root, third, and seventh (or sometimes the root and seventh, or root and third).\nUpper Structure Triads\nCombining a triad (often major or minor) over a different bass note to create complex chords (e.g., an E major triad over a C bass note for a Cmaj#11 sound). 1 - 3 - #11 - 7\nSo What Voicing\nBased on the voicing used in the Miles Davis tune \"So What,\" consisting of a stack of fourths with a major third on top (e.g., D-G-C-F-A). 1 - 4 - 7 - 3 - 6\nRootless Voicings\nRootless Left Hand Voicings: Often used in jazz, where the left hand plays the third and seventh (and possibly other tensions) while the root is implied or played by a bass player.\nGuide Tone Voicings\nChords reduced to their essential tones, often the third and seventh, which guide the harmony.\nPractical Examples\nCmaj7 (root position): C-E-G-B 1 - 3 - 5 - 7\nCmaj7 (1st inversion): E-G-B-C 3 - 5 - 7 - 1\nCmaj7 (2nd inversion): G-B-C-E 5 - 7 - 1 - 3\nCmaj7 (3rd inversion): B-C-E-G 7 - 1 - 3 - 5\nCmaj7 (closed voicing): C-E-G-B 1 - 3 - 5 - 7\nCmaj7 (open voicing): C-G-B-E 1 - 5 - 7 - 3\nCmaj7 (drop 2 voicing): G-C-E-B 5 - 1 - 3 - 7\nCmaj7 (shell voicing): C-E-B 1 - 3 - 7\nJazz-Specific Voicings\nC7 (rootless left hand voicing): E-Bb (3rd and 7th) 3 - b7\nC7 (upper structure triad): E-G#-C# (augmented triad over C) 3 - #5 - #1\nTips for Jazz Voicings\nUse Tensions: Add 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths to enrich the harmony.\nVoice Leading: Smooth transitions between chords by moving the smallest distance possible.\nAvoid Doubling: Especially the root and fifth, unless stylistically appropriate.","id":"https://daveads.github.io/note/piano-chord-voicing-techniques-in-jazz/","title":"Piano Chord Voicing Techniques in Jazz"},"https://daveads.github.io/note/postgresql/":{"body":"Postgresql Local development setup\nThere are no users in PostgreSQL, only roles.\npostgres account is created by default\nsudo -i -u postgres : To switch in the postgress account then psql to start postgresql interactive terminal\nOR\nsudo -u postgres psql : This log you directly into postgres\nTHIS COMMANDS CAN BE RUN WITH THE POSTGRESS ACCOUNT\n\\du : List all user accounts or roles\nCreating a new role\ncreateuser --interactive: Within the postgres account\nOr\nsudo -u postgres createuser --interactive without switching in the postgres account first\nWithin the postgresql interactive terminal\nSELECT datname FROM pg_database;

A multithreaded program appears to be doing several things at the same time even when it's running on a single-core machine.\nSynchronous: Tasks are performed one at a time, and you need to wait for one task to finish before moving to the next.\nAsynchronous: Can move to another task before the previous one finishes.

The problem with the coherence theory is that a belief could be consistent with my other beliefs and yet the whole lot could be false. —Colin McGinn (2015a, p. 148) According to the coherence theory of truth (see Young 2018), a set of propositions (or beliefs, or sentences) is true iff:they are mutually consistent, and 2.they are supported by, or consistent with, all available evidence; that is, they “cohere” with each other and with all evidence. Note that observation statements (that is, descriptions of what we observe in the world around us) are among the claims that must be mutually consistent, so this is\nnot (necessarily) a “pie-in-the-sky” theory that doesn’t have to relate to the way things\nreally are. It just says that we don’t have to have independent access to “reality” in\norder to determine truth.\n2.4.3Correspondence vs. Coherence Which theory is correct? Well, for one thing, there are more than two theories: There\nare several versions of each kind of theory, and there are other theories of truth that\ndon’t fall under either category. The most important of the other theories is the “prag-\nmatic” theory of truth (see Glanzberg 2016, §3; Misak and Talisse 2019). Here is one\nversion: [T]he pragmatic theory of truth . . . is that a proposition is true if and only\n[if] it is useful [that is, “pragmatic”, or practical] to believe that proposi-\ntion. (McGinn, 2015a, p. 148, my interpolated brackets)\nAnother version states that a belief, proposition, or sentence is true iff it continues to\nbe accepted at the limit of inquiry:\nTruth is that to which a belief would tend were it to tend indefinitely to a fixed\nbelief.

Peirce; lectures on the theory of\nknowledge,Spring 1973; for more on Peirce, see §2.6.1.3,below.)46\nIndentation in python is very important because with out proper indenting you will end up seeing IndentationError: examples as seen below\nIn python when defining statement for functions and loops you do this using four white spaces or a single tab according to python indentation rules\nImportants of indentation:\nhelps to properly structure the code\nmakes the code beautiful (human readable)\nPython's Style guide pep8\nsource code","id":"https://daveads.github.io/writing/indentation-in-python/","title":"Indentation in Python"},"https://daveads.github.io/writing/innovation-in-developing-countries/":{"body":"Note: These are based on my views on factors affecting the rate of innovation in developing countries. I might be wrong, but at the same time, I might be right.\nWriting this article feels a little weird for me; it seems like something I should not write about, but I also have the feeling that I should do it anyway. Keeping this as short as possible, I won't be able to cover all areas.\nPeople in developing countries seem to believe that the governing entities are solely responsible for bringing about technological innovation (this is done indirectly), which is something I strongly disagree with. I guess I am not expressing this in the right way; coming from a tech background, there is a lot I don't fully understand about politics. It's not an excuse, but rather than complaining, that energy should be directed towards something else.\nSecondly, the mindset (culture) and beliefs of the people are really mind-blowing. I love this quote: \"You are what you believe in.\" It's really funny how, at the age of 20-25 in most cases, you are still considered incapable of making decisions that could cause a serious change in society, down to individual families, and this becomes a loop.\nIt makes me wonder what the adults spend their youthful age doing in their 20's....??? This makes me want to give examples of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg...\nTo a point, you can't entirely blame society for this; many youths spend their time in the most unproductive ways you could ever think of, involving themselves in internet fraud and other criminal activities, etc.\nThere is a lot at play here:\nLack of knowledge, even in a major field (poor education background, mostly outdated curriculum).\nLack of infrastructure, etc.\nTechnological innovation can be brought about by innovative individuals (Tech Visionaries) who:\nx. See things differently.\nx. Have a serious, intense passion for what they do.\nx. Are ready to take action no matter the odds.\nx. Are tired of doing things the old way (with low outcomes).\nx. Are highly curious (question everything) and have the ability to connect the dots.\nDon't get me wrong, one person can't actually change the world; you are going to work together with intelligent humans and people who think alike to actually make a mark.","id":"https://daveads.github.io/writing/innovation-in-developing-countries/","title":"Technological Innovation in developing countries"},"https://daveads.github.io/writing/interesting-programming-and-cs-books/":{"body":"// Books i find interesting....

The shell is a program that takes in Commands or #keywords and passes them to the operating system to carry out. it's a way of interacting with the computer os, similiar to the GUI but faster and more powerful. The program which handles this commands in the terminal emulator is the Command-line interpreter (shell).\nShell Scripting:\nAs earlier said a Unix shell or shell is a command-line interpreter but also a programming language, the programming language features allows us to combine commands or (utilities) together in a file and run them as a scripts, and yea you can also call it a Script language for now the major focus is getting you to understand the command line and having the feels of it without getting intimidated.. will write more on Shell script on Using The Linux Command Line(1) or probably the next.\nRunning the Termainal emulator:\nComputer terminal:\nBefore delving into what the Terminal emulator actually is, it's important to know where it all started decades ago. Computers had no GUI for accessing or modifying data; the computer terminal was the only means of entering, displaying, and printing data. These terminals were physical computing devices like IBM 3270, VT100, and many others. For more details, check out computer terminal &gt;&gt; wiki.\nWhat's a Terminal emulator:\nThe Terminal emulator is a software designed to replicate the functions of a computer terminal. It is a GUI application needed to access the Unix shell environment, providing an interface to invoke commands, scripts, and programs available on your system. It also allows you to view and browse through the contents of directories, just like you would with a FILE MANAGER APPLICATION.\nEvery Linux distro comes with a default terminal emulator. For instance, Ubuntu and Fedora come with Gnome terminal emulator, and other Linux distros have their own defaults. The first thing you see in the terminal emulator is the \"command prompt,\" which shows $, %, #, or &gt;, indicating the current working directory, the current user, and the readiness of the shell to accept commands from you.\nThe default shell for most Unix or Unix-like systems is the bash shell. Other shells include sh, zsh, csh, and more. To find out the available shells on your system, use the command:\nDisplay content in your file directory\nThe ls command is used to print out the current directory on the terminal emulator screen, giving the same result as the File Manager.\nTo find out what a command means through the command line, type:\nYou can also make use of the system's manual pager for the full documentation:\nTo print your current working directory, use the command pwd.\nThe pwd is a built-in command within the bash shell itself. Type help to find out more about built-in commands.\nTime for Experiments\nHere are some common commands:\nCommandMeaning\nlsList files and directories in the current directory.\ncdChange the current working directory.\npwdPrint the current working directory.\nmkdirCreate a new directory (folder).\nrmdirRemove a directory (folder).\ncpCopy files or directories.\nmvMove or rename files or directories.\nrmRemove (delete) files or directories.\ncatConcatenate and display file content.\nmoreDisplay file content one screen at a time.\nlessDisplay file content with backward navigation.\nheadDisplay the beginning lines of a file.\ntailDisplay the ending lines of a file.\ngrepSearch for a pattern in files.\nfindSearch for files and directories.\nchmodChange file permissions.\nchownChange file ownership.\npsDisplay information about running processes.\nkillTerminate processes.\nsshSecure Shell - remote login to a server.\nwgetDownload files from the web.\ntarArchive files using tar.\nzipPackage and compress files.\nPlease note that this is not an exhaustive list, but it includes some commonly used commands and their primary meanings. Additionally, the meaning of some commands may vary based on their options and arguments. Always refer to the manual (man command) for a comprehensive understanding of each command.\nResources\nThe Missing Semester of Your CS Education By Mit","id":"https://daveads.github.io/writing/the-linux-command-line/","title":"The Linux Command line interface(0)"},"https://daveads.github.io/writing/thinking-while-walking/":{"body":"Having been experiencing writer’s block since the last time i wrote new resolution, Recently i was asked why i preferred walking to driving or using the public transport, i was unable to give a straight answer to that, Though i had reasons i just don't know why it happens.\nE.g:\nWalking helped me fix more bugs than i could imagine..\nI do most of my best thinking while walking alone*.\nIt helps me calm my nerves…\nYet i was unable to put the whole piece together,the question fired up more unanswered questions, so i did some googling.\nThe Science behind it:\nWhen we go for a walk, the heart pumps faster, circulating more blood and oxygen not just to the muscles but to all the organs—including the brain, Walking on a regular basis also promotes new connections between brain cells, staves off the usual withering of brain tissue that comes with age, increases the volume of the hippocampus (a brain region crucial for memory), and elevates levels of molecules that both stimulate the growth of new neurons and transmit messages between them.\nBenefit of walking :\nWalking boost creativity.\nWalking sparks connections between brain cells.\nIt strengthens your hippocampus.\nWalking increases blood flow in your brain\nArticles\nwalking Vs sitting\nwalking helps us think\nbenfits of walking\nways walking changes your brain","id":"https://daveads.github.io/writing/thinking-while-walking/","title":"How thinking while walking helps in fixing bugs"},"https://daveads.github.io/writing/two-mind-blowing-articles/":{"body":"Articles on Startups and Success\nHow To Be Successful\nHard Startups\nHow to be successful :\nEveryone has a different definition of success, irrespective of those beliefs we all do have a specific goal in mind that is to be successful.\nMeaning we do all have to put in the hard work, sleepless night and also working smart.\nSam altman actually explained, so I won't go into full details you can always read the articles.\nSelf belief:\nNot believing in yourself makes the whole process even harder, this made me remember one of steve job's quote..\n\"The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the one who do.\"\nLearning to think independently:\nThere is always a solution to every problem, success is actually 99% failure and 1% success, one thing i learn to do is treat every failed attempt as an experiment or a learning process...\nFocus:\nThis is one of the quality i currently lack, According to Steve Jobs,\n“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on.
