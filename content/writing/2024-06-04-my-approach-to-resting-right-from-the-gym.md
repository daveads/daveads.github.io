One thing you shouldn't do when aiming to take a rest is to spend more than a month resting. You are pretty much reversing all that hard work. I am actually known as the guy that can never take a rest from the gym...

**Spoilers**<br>
I once told [@soso](https://www.instagram.com/the.afro.poet/) and [@Retr0ville](https://github.com/Retr0ville) that I was going to take a break from the gym for a week and ended up going to two gym sessions during the same week. Weird, right? :) //There are a couple more examples.


<br>

### How would I take a proper rest assuming I am willing to take a one-month rest?

* I would go to the gym once a week and do a 1-rep max on all my major exercises. We should probably call this **Powerlifting**, I guess.<br> //If this isn't an option, get two dumbbells at home.

* Keep up with my normal nutrition and I would advise you to eat more.

This is how I would take a proper rest... I actually don't have a scientific backing for this or can give professional advice for this, but if you do have a research paper showing how this should be done properly, shoot me an email at [the.daveads@gmail.com](mailto:the.daveads@gmail.com).
