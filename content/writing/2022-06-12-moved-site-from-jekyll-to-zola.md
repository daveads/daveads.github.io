Moved from jekyll to zola, still using my loosely edited version of `Jekyll Minima` scss styling from the earlier version of this site.

Zola solves most of my issues in jekyll without breaking a sweat and it's written in `Rust` and uses [Tera](https://github.com/Keats/tera) template engine.

zola version :- v0.15.3
