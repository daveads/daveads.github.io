After transitioning from Jekyll to Zola, I have updated the website's styling by loosely adapting the `Jekyll Minima` SCSS. Zola has proven to be an excellent choice as it seamlessly resolves many of the issues I faced with Jekyll. The fact that Zola is written in `Rust` and utilizes the powerful [Tera](https://github.com/Keats/tera) template engine further enhances its appeal.

The current version of Zola that I am using is v0.15.3, and it has been performing admirably. For those interested in learning more about Zola and its capabilities, the repository can be found here: [zola-repo](https://github.com/getzola/zola). Additionally, the documentation is available at [zola-doc](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/).

With Zola, I feel confident in the future of my website, and I am excited about exploring its features and possibilities.
