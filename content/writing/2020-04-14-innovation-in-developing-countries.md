<b>Note:</b> This are based on my views on things affecting the rate of innovation in developing countries, i might be wrong but at same time right.

Writing this article feels a little weird for me, feels like something i should not write about but also having the feeling do it anyway. **keeping this as short as possible, Won't be able to touch all areas**


People in developing countries seem to have the believe that the governing entities are the bodies that can bring about increase Technological Innovation **(this is done in directly)** which is something i **strongly disagree** With, i guess am not putting this in a right way, **coming from a tech background** there is a lot i don't fully know about politics which is not an excuse, but rather than complaining that energy should be transferred to something else.

 
Secondly, the mindset (culture) and belief of the people is really mind blowing, i love this quote<br> 
<cite>You are what you believe in.</cite> it's really funny how at the age of 20-25 in most cases you are still consider as incapable of making decisions that could cause a serious change by the society down to the individual families, and this is more like a loop.<br> 

**Keeps me wondering what the Adults spends their youthful age doing in their 20's....???** Make you want to give examples of Bill gate, Steve jobs, Mark Zuckerberg...

To a point you won't blame the society for this, most youths spend there time in the most unproductive way you could ever think of, involving themselves in internet fraud and other criminal activities e.t.c 


**There is a lot at play here:**
1. lack of knowledge even in a majored field (poor education background mostly outdated curriculum).
2. infrastructures. e.t.c



Technological innovation can be brought about by innovative individuals (Tech Visionaries), individuals who

x. See things differently.<br>
x. have a serious intense passion for what they do.<br>
x. ready to take action no matter the odds.<br>
x. tired of doing things the old way (with ow outcomes)<br>
x. highly currious (Questions Everything) ability to connect the dots.<br>


Don't get me wrong, one person can't actually change the world you are going to work together with intelligent humans and people who think alike to actually make a mark.
