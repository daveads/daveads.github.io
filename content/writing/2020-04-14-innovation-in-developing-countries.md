<b>Note:</b> These are based on my views on factors affecting the rate of innovation in developing countries. I might be wrong, but at the same time, I might be right.

Writing this article feels a little weird for me; it seems like something I should not write about, but I also have the feeling that I should do it anyway. **Keeping this as short as possible, I won't be able to cover all areas.**

People in developing countries seem to believe that the governing entities are solely responsible for bringing about technological innovation **(this is done indirectly)**, which is something I **strongly disagree with**. I guess I am not expressing this in the right way; coming from a tech background, there is a lot I don't fully understand about politics. It's not an excuse, but rather than complaining, that energy should be directed towards something else.

Secondly, the mindset (culture) and beliefs of the people are really mind-blowing. I love this quote: <cite>"You are what you believe in."</cite> It's really funny how, at the age of 20-25 in most cases, you are still considered incapable of making decisions that could cause a serious change in society, down to individual families, and this becomes a loop.

**It makes me wonder what the adults spend their youthful age doing in their 20's....???** This makes me want to give examples of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg...

To a point, you can't entirely blame society for this; many youths spend their time in the most unproductive ways you could ever think of, involving themselves in internet fraud and other criminal activities, etc.

**There is a lot at play here:**

1. Lack of knowledge, even in a major field (poor education background, mostly outdated curriculum).
2. Lack of infrastructure, etc.

Technological innovation can be brought about by innovative individuals (Tech Visionaries) who:

x. See things differently.<br>
x. Have a serious, intense passion for what they do.<br>
x. Are ready to take action no matter the odds.<br>
x. Are tired of doing things the old way (with low outcomes).<br>
x. Are highly curious (question everything) and have the ability to connect the dots.<br>

Don't get me wrong, one person can't actually change the world; you are going to work together with intelligent humans and people who think alike to actually make a mark.
