Glancing through the book [Deep work](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455586692/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1455586692&linkCode=as2&tag=daveads-20&linkId=383da9e80b4b22401dcdef4c58418841), the term "knowledge workers" caught my attention, this is something i do without actually knowing what kind of work it is classified as.

Did some research on [knowledge worker](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/knowledge-workers/)

According to that article, knowledge workers are said to think for a living, unlike manual labourers who are paid for performing a physical tasks, and according to wiki knowledge workers are workers whose main capital is knowledge.

## Back to the article:

**"knowledge worker"** was first coined by peter drucker in
his book "The Land of Tomorrow"...  the knowledge worker are differentiated by their ability to solve complex problems or to develop new products or services in their fields of expertise.. "which his a clear definition of an actual computer programmer's job"


knowledge workers can be programmers, architects, engineers, marketers, design thinkers, public accountants, lawyers, and academics, and essentially any other white-collar worker who uses judgement and critical thinking in their role.
