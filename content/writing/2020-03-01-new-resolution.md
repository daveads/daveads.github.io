## my new resolution (covid-19)

To be honest right now i feel down because i am unable to do anything meaningful to help during critical moment, makes me feel stupid but i have a very strong feeling this is the last time this is going to happen to me.

Don't get me wrong staying at home actually helps but to me it does not, should be able to help by working together with health professional or providing finical asistance... Still can't shake that feeling of my head that there is still alot i have to do and am not fully commited to it..


**My resolution** is to write one article once a week or probably everyday if possible, this is going to be really hard for me but i feel optimistic about it.
