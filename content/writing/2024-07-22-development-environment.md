This post was originally intended to be about [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) configuration, but changed its focus along the way.

**Operating System:**<br>
I was never a big fan of Windows, though I started with it. I disliked dealing with numerous floating windows just to complete a task that can be done within the terminal window. you don't get to choose your **window manager**, **login manager** or choose when to upgrade e.t.c. *You basically don't own that computer*.

**0 Computer ::** [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)<br>
    I switch between [Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) and [i3](https://github.com/i3/i3) tiling window managers, for reasons that are admittedly somewhat amusing.

**1 Computer ::** [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)<br>
    Also equipped with i3 and Sway tiling window managers.

**2 Computer ::** :}

<br>
I tend to gravitate towards tools written in my favorite programming languages and projects i could potentially contribute to when needed (with the exception of VSCode).
<br>
<br>

**Code Editors::**<br>
I switch between Vim/Neovim and VSCode, depending on my mood. Occasionally, I use [Lapce](https://github.com/lapce/lapce) as well.

**Neovim Configuration::**

<br><br>
My Neovim configuration looks like the picture above... lol that is exactly how it looks... if you're curious, check out My [Configs](https://github.com/daveads/.sys_s)

For terminal emulator, I use [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), and for terminal multiplexing, I primarily use [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux). My shell environment is mostly Bash.

**Browsers::**<br>
While I prefer [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), And occasionally chrome and brave
