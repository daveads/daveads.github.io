**How to be successful :**

Everyone has a different definition of success, irrespective of those beliefs we all do have a specific goal in mind that is to be successful.
Meaning we do all have to put in the hard work, sleepless night and also working smart.  

 Sam altman actually explained, so I won't go into full details you can always read the articles.

* **Self belief**:
Not believing in yourself makes the whole process even [harder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFE-Tdz24hM&feature=youtu.be), this made me remember one of steve job's quote.. 
> "**The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the one who do.**"

<br>

* **Learning to think independently**:
There is always a solution to every problem, **success is actually 99% failure and 1% success**, one thing i learn to do is treat every failed attempt as an experiment or a learning process...

<br>
* **Focus**:  
This is one of the quality i currently lack, According to Steve Jobs, 
> â€œ**People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done.**"

# Others i consider important
* **becoming hard to compete with**
* **be bold**
* **be internally driven**
* **Taking risks**
* **be good at sales**
* **build a network**
* **You get rich by owning things**


# **Hard startups**
Everyone has a different perspective to this, I like the writer's perspective and also belief startup founders should have a long-term commitment. This made me curious **what should startup in developing countries focus on...?**
