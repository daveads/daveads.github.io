Once upon a time I used to Imagine the power one person could hold if they truly understood how technology works.

Now, that idea feels a bit shaky because thinking has been outsourced to LLMs.

But using your brain is just as important as going to the gym, it’s how you stay mentally strong.

It’s okay to be clueless or make unhealthy decisions at some point in your life, just make sure you start using your brain before it’s too late.


It’s important you take note of how new technology affects you.

* Learn how to learn  *//learn to push your self*
* Understand how thing works on a deeper level. 

Be the control freak to LLm... 

> Learn to use your brain.

At some point in the future, thinking might just be the next new thing.
