### Do Not Read This

I think it's important to write this up as a letter or reminder to myself.

- **Don't ever give up.**

- **Always remember your goals.**

- **You don't need to know everything, but you can #cs_math.**

- **Read a lot of books and read widely.**

- **Learn to read scientific papers and also contribute.**

- **Code every day.**

- **Learn not to give a f*ck about what people say or think when they don't actually know where you are headed.**

- **Languages are just tools.**

- **Be yourself.**

- **Don't be a perfectionist. // I think I am already.**

- **Remember you are awesome and special.**

- **Listen to what everyone processes it and see which is useful to you.**

- **I know you are already curious; I don't have to tell you to be.**

- **Remember the WORD.**

- **Practice, practice, practice.**

- **It's "OK" not to follow the crowd; don't feel left out.**

- **Respect your parents.**

**Always check this out (LOOP_THIS IF POSSIBLE).**
