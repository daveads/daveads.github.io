Having been experiencing writer’s block since the last time i wrote [new resolution](https://daveads.github.io/personal/2020/03/01/New-resolution.html), Recently i was asked why i preferred walking to driving or using the public transport, i was unable to give a straight answer to that, Though i had reasons i just don't know why it happens.

E.g:

* **Walking helped me fix more bugs than i could imagine**..

* I do most of my best thinking while walking alone*.

* It helps me calm my nerves…

Yet i was unable to put the whole piece together,the question fired up more unanswered questions, so i did some **googling**.


# **The Science behind it:**

> When we go for a walk, the heart pumps faster, circulating more blood and oxygen not just to the muscles but to all the organs—including the brain,  Walking on a regular basis also promotes new connections between brain cells, staves off the usual withering of brain tissue that comes with age, increases the volume of the hippocampus (a brain region crucial for memory), and elevates levels of molecules that both stimulate the growth of new neurons and transmit messages between them.

# Benefit of walking :

* Walking boost creativity.

* Walking sparks connections between brain cells.

* It strengthens your hippocampus.

* Walking increases blood flow in your brain
