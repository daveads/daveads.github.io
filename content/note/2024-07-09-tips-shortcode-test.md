# My Zola Blog Post

Welcome to my blog post about using Zola shortcodes!

{% tip(header="Did you know?") %}
Zola is a fast static site generator written in Rust. It's known for its simplicity and speed!
{% end %}


## Testing**

{% tip(header="Pro Tip") %}
You can nest Markdown within your [callouts](callouts). For example:

- Use **bold** for emphasis
- Create lists like this one
- Even add [links](https://www.getzola.org/)

Tips make your content more engaging and easier to read!
{% end %}

I hope this helps you understand how to use tips in your Zola site!
