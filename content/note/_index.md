**Needed a way keep track of all my readings** && and view them when needed

I do have a **physcial notes** but they always end up some where i can't really keep track of


This contains unfinished notes from books, videos, articles i have read or will be reading pretty soon.


NOTICE!!!

* **Book are almost never finished**
* **Am not going to always write notes on everything i read in a day so this will likely be 50-70% of my readings**
* **This for some reasons won't be in an orderly manner //will fix that later**
* loading....
