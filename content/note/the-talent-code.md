Neural insulator called **myelin**............???


Human Skills are created by chains of nerve fibers carrying a tiny electrical impulse.. **myelin wraps those nerve fibers**, making the signal stronger and faster preventing leakage.


When we fire our circuits the right way --when we practice playing that notes<br>
Our myelin responds by wrapping layers of insulation around that neural circuit, each new layer adding a bit more skill and speed.
