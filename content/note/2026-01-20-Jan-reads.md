### My January Reads

* [Addicted to being useful](https://www.seangoedecke.com/addicted-to-being-useful/)

    **//Thoughts**

    I feel there is always going to be something to do, working on something entirely new, something that never existed, something that requires a new kind of architecture.

    Something the world needs. Human needs are endless. There might be some already known patterns, but there are always unknown patterns too.

    >> I’m probably also addicted to being useful just like **Akaky Akayevich**.
