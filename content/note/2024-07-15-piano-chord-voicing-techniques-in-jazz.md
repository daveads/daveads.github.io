Voicing chords on the piano involves creatively arranging the notes of a chord to achieve different textures and harmonies. Common methods of voicing chords:

### Root Position and Inversions

- **Root Position:** The root of the chord is the lowest note.  1 - 3 - 5 - 7
- **1st Inversion:** The third of the chord is the lowest note. 3 - 5 - 7 - 1
- **2nd Inversion:** The fifth of the chord is the lowest note. 5 - 7 - 1 - 3
- **3rd Inversion (for 7th chords):** The seventh of the chord is the lowest note. 7 - 1 - 3 - 5

### Closed and Open Voicings

- **Closed Voicing:** All chord tones are within an octave. 1 - 3 - 5 - 7
- **Open Voicing:** Chord tones are spread out, often spanning more than an octave. 1 - 5 - 7 - 3 

### Drop Voicings

- **Drop 2 Voicing:** The second highest note of a closed voicing is dropped an octave.     5 - 1 - 3 - 7
- **Drop 3 Voicing:** The third highest note of a closed voicing is dropped an octave.      3 - 7 - 1 - 5      
- **Drop 2 and 4 Voicing:** Both the second and fourth highest notes are dropped an octave. 3 - 5 - 7 - 1

### Quartal and Quintal Voicings

- **Quartal Voicing:** Chords built in fourths (e.g., C-F-Bb).  1 - 4 - b7 (or 1 - 4 - 7)
- **Quintal Voicing:** Chords built in fifths (e.g., C-G-D).    1 - 5 - 9
 
### Cluster Voicings

- **Tone Clusters:** Chords with notes that are close together, often including seconds and minor seconds.

### Shell Voicings

- **Left Hand Shells:** Often used in jazz, consisting of the root, third, and seventh (or sometimes the root and seventh, or root and third).

### Upper Structure Triads

Combining a triad (often major or minor) over a different bass note to create complex chords (e.g., an E major triad over a C bass note for a Cmaj#11 sound).  1 - 3 - #11 - 7

### So What Voicing

Based on the voicing used in the Miles Davis tune "So What," consisting of a stack of fourths with a major third on top (e.g., D-G-C-F-A).  1 - 4 - 7 - 3 - 6

### Rootless Voicings

- **Rootless Left Hand Voicings:** Often used in jazz, where the left hand plays the third and seventh (and possibly other tensions) while the root is implied or played by a bass player.

### Guide Tone Voicings

Chords reduced to their essential tones, often the third and seventh, which guide the harmony.

### Practical Examples

- **Cmaj7 (root position):** C-E-G-B    1 - 3 - 5 - 7
- **Cmaj7 (1st inversion):** E-G-B-C    3 - 5 - 7 - 1
- **Cmaj7 (2nd inversion):** G-B-C-E    5 - 7 - 1 - 3
- **Cmaj7 (3rd inversion):** B-C-E-G    7 - 1 - 3 - 5
- **Cmaj7 (closed voicing):** C-E-G-B   1 - 3 - 5 - 7
- **Cmaj7 (open voicing):** C-G-B-E     1 - 5 - 7 - 3
- **Cmaj7 (drop 2 voicing):** G-C-E-B   5 - 1 - 3 - 7
- **Cmaj7 (shell voicing):** C-E-B      1 - 3 - 7

### Jazz-Specific Voicings

- **C7 (rootless left hand voicing):** E-Bb (3rd and 7th)   3 - b7
- **C7 (upper structure triad):** E-G#-C# (augmented triad over C)  3 - #5 - #1


{% tip(header="Tips for Jazz Voicings") %}
- **Use Tensions:** Add 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths to enrich the harmony.
- **Voice Leading:** Smooth transitions between chords by moving the smallest distance possible.
- **Avoid Doubling:** Especially the root and fifth, unless stylistically appropriate.
